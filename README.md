## Features

#### User-Friendly Interface
InTransact features an intuitive interface that allows you to input and manage inventory information quickly and easily. With its streamlined operations, you can get started and utilize the app without hassle.

#### File-Based Management
With document-based storage, you can easily backup, restore, and share your transaction data. You can sync your data across different devices using iCloud, ensuring your information remains up-to-date and synchronized with your inventory.

#### Rich Transaction Data
Capture detailed information such as transaction dates, keeper names, and comments. You can add and edit details for each item in a transaction, including item ID, item name, variant name, quantity, price and detailed tax information. It automatically aggregates transactions to get the current stock level by item names. You can save item information as templates so you don't have to type the same information all over again. 

#### Line-Level Tax Calculation
InTransact uses the line-level model to calculate tax for you, and you just need to provide tax rates. With customizable rounding settings, you can accurately determine the tax amount for each item in a transaction.

#### Export to CSV
You can quickly export the data you need from an InTransact Document to CSV format so that you can achieve more with your favourite spreadsheet application.
